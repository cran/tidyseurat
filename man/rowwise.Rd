\details{
`rowwise()` is used for the results of [do()] when you
create list-variables. It is also useful to support arbitrary
complex operations that need to be applied to each row.

Currently, rowwise grouping only works with data frames. Its
main impact is to allow you to work with list-variables in
[summarise()] and [mutate()] without having to
use \code{[[1]]}. This makes `summarise()` on a rowwise tbl
effectively equivalent to [plyr::ldply()].
